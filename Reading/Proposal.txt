ILLUMINATING THE COSMIC FOG: THE CIRCUMGALACTIC MEDIUM AND THE
INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM IN SIMULATIONS AND OBSERVATIONS
Antareep Gogoi, PhD Proposal

Supervising Professor: Dr. Lindsay J. King, Chair

The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a pivotal role in the evolution of galaxies in the
Universe. Being the interface between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the galaxies
themselves, the CGM acts as a reservoir for gas inflows and also as a sink for galactic outflows.
This PhD project aims to investigate the physical, thermal and kinematical properties of the
gas in the CGM, with an emphasis on understanding the temperature-density relationship
of the gas and effect of galactic feedback processes in these regions. To achieve this, we
employ two high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulation suites: the Sherwood
simulations and IllustrisTNG simulations. These simulations provide a range of models and
feedback mechanisms to explore the influence of stellar and active galactic nuclei (AGN)
feedback on the gas properties surrounding the galaxies.
A significant component of this work involves comparing simulation outputs with observational data from quasar sightlines, focusing on the Lyman-alpha forest as a probe of diffuse
hydrogen in the IGM and CGM. We leverage a variety of subgrid physics models, including
those for stellar winds and AGN feedback, to test the accuracy and limitations of current
feedback prescriptions in simulations. We are also interested in investigating how the CGM
evolves with time at different redshifts and how these feedback processes effect its evolution. The insights gained from this study will contribute to our knowledge of the complex
multi-phase CGM and their interaction with their host galaxies and the IGM.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1

A very brief history of the universe

According to the Big Bang theory, all visible matter in the universe originated from an
extremely hot and dense plasma composed of primordial hydrogen and helium, formed within
the first few minutes of the universe’s creation. By the time the universe was around 300,000
years old, this ionized plasma had cooled as the universe expanded, allowing electrons to
combine with hydrogen and helium nuclei. This process, known as “recombination”, released
excess energy in the form of photons, which we observe today as the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) radiation. After the CMB was first detected (Penzias and Wilson, 1965),
it provided crucial evidence that ruled out the possibility of the universe being composed
entirely of visible matter (or baryons).
Today, we understand that baryons account for less than 20% of the matter in the
universe, with the remaining portion being dark matter (Hu and Dodelson, 2002). While
the exact nature of dark matter remains one of the great unsolved mysteries of modern
science, the most widely accepted theory is that it consists of cold, heavy, and collisionless
particles that interact with baryonic matter only through gravity—a model known as Cold
Dark Matter (CDM).
The extremely small temperature fluctuations, on the order of 10−5 , detected in the
otherwise uniform CMB, served as the seeds for dark matter to begin clustering. Dark matter,
being unaffected by radiation, began to fall into these tiny gravitational potential wells,
forming the first large-scale structures in the universe (Peebles, 1980). Baryonic matter, in
turn, followed the gravitational pull of dark matter, accumulating in these regions of higher
density. In the densest regions, the first stars ignited, marking the birth of the first galaxies.
Over time, the intense radiation from these early stars and galaxies reionized the neutral
gas in the universe, ending the “cosmic dark ages” and initiating the epoch of reionization
(Rees, 1998).
While galaxies and stars formed in the densest regions of the universe, a significant
portion of the baryonic matter remained in diffuse, gaseous form, filling the vast spaces
between galaxies. Most of these baryons are highly ionized, existing in the intergalactic
medium (IGM) and the circumgalactic medium (CGM)—the latter being the tenuous gas
that surrounds galaxies, acting as a bridge between the IGM and the galaxy itself. These
ionized gases play a crucial role in the history of the universe as they regulate processes
such as structure formation, star formation, galaxy evolution, and supermassive black hole
accretion. Figure 1.1, summarizes everything discussed above.
This PhD proposal focuses on investigating the thermal, chemical and kinematical properties of the CGM, espicially on its temperature, density, metallicity, and ionization state.
By comparing results from cosmological simulations with observational data, we will assess
the accuracy of current models in capturing the behavior of the CGM and IGM.

1.2

The Intergalactic Medium

The intergalactic medium (IGM) is the vast, sparsely populated space between galaxies. The
objects in the IGM can be roughly thought of as unvirialized particles that are not bound
by the gravitational pull of a galaxy’s dark matter halo including particles within small
dark matter halos (< 109 M⊙ ) that are too small to host galaxies. The IGM constitutes a
significant portion of the universe’s baryonic matter. Until redshift, z = 3, more than 90%
of the baryons were in diffuse gas form in the IGM.
The IGM’s structure follows the gravitational potential wells created by clustering dark
matter (DM) as a result of primordial density fluctuations. Observed from large distances,
the IGM resembles a complex web of interconnected structures, aptly named the “cosmic
web”. Figure 1.2 shows a 2D visualization of the cosmic web from a simulation box used in
this project. The structure consists of four main features: voids, filaments, sheets, and knots.
The voids represent the least dense regions in the universe, often several tens to hundreds of
Megaparsecs (Mpc) in size, with particle number densities as low as 10−7 cm−3 (for context,
2

this equates to the volume of approximately a hundred Earths to contain a mole of gas!). In
contrast, clusters of galaxies form in the denser regions of filaments and knots. The IGM is
connected to the clusters via huge sheets and filaments of gas, feeding the galaxies inside it
with fresh gas essential for star formation.

Figure 1.2 A 2D-visualization of the cosmic web from the fiducial (wind+AGN) simulation
boxes of the Sherwood simulation suite. The left panel shows the gas density and the right
panel shows the temperature of the gas.
The temperature within the IGM also varies significantly across different regions. Away
from the galaxy clusters, the gas is primarily heated up by the background ultra-violet(UV)
radiation from luminous galaxies and quasars, maintaining temperatures close to photoionization equilibrium at around 104 K. But near the denser regions, where gas flows from voids
into filaments, heating occurs due to collisions and turbulence, with temperatures reaching
up to 105 to 107 K. The filaments themselves are connected to each other via knots, where
the biggest clusters in the universe form. In these regions, it is possible for gas to be present
at even higher temperatures of around 108 K.
These diffuse gases in the IGM play a pivotal role in cosmic history, influencing structure
formation, galaxy evolution, and star formation by acting as a vast cosmic reservoir that
galaxies draw from for star formation. Understanding the IGM’s evolution sheds light on key
cosmological phenomena, such as the epoch of reionization, large-scale structure formation,
baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAOs), and the primordial abundances of elements.
In the following sections, we will discuss the developments that form the modern understanding of the IGM. While there are several methods to probe the IGM, this chapter will
focus on the Lyman-α forest, a primary tool for studying the IGM and especially relevant
to this project.
3

1.2.1

The Lyman α Forest

The primary way to probe the gas in the IGM is to look at the absorption lines in the
spectrum of a bright background source whose intrinsic spectrum is well-known. The most
obvious absorption line to look for would be the Lyman-α (Lyα) line of the neutral hydrogen
atom as it is the most abundant element in the universe. Due to the expansion of the universe,
light gets redshifted as it travels through large distances. This implies that depending on the
distance from a neutral hydrogen gas cloud to an observer, the wavelength at which the Lyα
resonant line is observedbwill be different. The closer the gas is, the bluer this wavelength
would be following the relation,
z=

λobs − λrest
λrest

(1.1)

where z is redshift, λobs is observed wavelength of the absorption line and λrest = 1215.67Åis
the rest wavelength of Lyα resonance.
Soon after the first detection of distant quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) by Schmidt (1965), it
was proposed that these Lyman-α absorption lines from intervening neutral hydrogen in the
IGM should be observable in their spectra (Bahcall and Salpeter, 1965; Gunn and Peterson,
1965). Although discrete absorption lines were indeed detected in QSO spectra, the exact
origin of these lines remained controversial for several years, until higher-order lines in the
Lyman series were also identified Baldwin (1977). The collection of these discrete “tree-like”
absorption lines, located blueward of the Lyman-α emission line of the QSO, became known
as the Lyman-α forest (Lynds, 1971; Sargent et al., 1980). Figure 1.3 shows an example of
a quasar spectrum where the Lyα forest can be clearly seen blueward of the intrinstic Lyα
emmision peak of the quasar itself.

Figure 1.3 A spectrum of the QSO J132029-052335 taken by the VLT/UVES spectrigraph.
The spectrum is shifted into the rest frame of the source. The forest of Lyman α absorption
lines can be seen to the left of the Ly-α emmission line of the QSO at its rest wavelength of
1216Å.
A major leap in the study of the Lyman-α forest occurred with the introduction of the
High-Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) on the Keck telescope Vogt et al. (1994).
4

High-resolution QSO spectra obtained through HIRES (Hu et al., 1995; Kim et al., 1997)
provided unprecedented detail, revealing that the Lyman-α forest traces highly photoionized,
diffuse gas in the filaments, sheets, and halos of the cosmic web. These structures are
consistent with our picture of structure formation resulting from gravitational collapse in
a universe dominated by CDM, with an approximately uniform ionizing background (Cen
et al., 1994; Hernquist et al., 1996).
Studying these absorption lines gives us valuable information about the IGM. The strength
of the line gives us the information about the amount of intervening gas the light has passed
through. The width of an absorption line, in the other hand, is dictated by the Hubble flow
across the gas cloud, thermal broadening and turbulence. The techniques for analyzing these
absorption lines will be discussed in detail in Chapter 2.

1.3

The Circumgalactic Medium

Observations have shown that all galaxies are surrounded by massive gaseous atmospheres.
The first evidence for such an atmosphere came from observations of our own Milky Way
galaxy. Guido Münch observed neutral sodium (Na I) and singly-ionized calcium (Ca II)
absorption lines in the spectra of stars located above the Milky Way’s disk (Münch and
Zirin, 1961). He presented these findings to Lyman Spitzer, noting that the absorption
lines suggested a temperature of T ∼ 100 K and a particle density of n ∼ 10 cm−3 . Spitzer
interpreted these observations as evidence of a much hotter (T ∼ 106 K) and more diffuse
ambient medium surrounding the cooler gas clouds, which would be necessary to confine
these clouds in a state of pressure equilibrium (Spitzer, 1956). This interpretation led to the
conceptualization of the existence of a “Galactic corona.”
In parallel with studies of the Lyα forest using QSO absorption lines, researchers observed
that strong Lyα, CIV, and other metal absorption lines often originate in the extended halos
of galaxies, suggesting the presence of a substantial gaseous medium near galaxies (Lanzetta
et al., 1995; Chen et al., 2001). Today, this complex, multi-phase gaseous region around
galaxies is known as the circumgalactic medium (CGM) (Steidel et al., 2010; Tumlinson
et al., 2017). The CGM is a critical component of galaxy ecosystems, acting as a reservoir
of gas that feeds galaxies while also receiving material ejected by stellar winds and active
galactic nuclei (AGN). This dynamic interaction between galaxies and the CGM plays a
pivotal role in shaping galaxy evolution by regulating star formation and redistributing
heavy elements. As galaxies grow and evolve, they exchange gas with their surroundings,
making the CGM an essential element in understanding galaxy formation and evolution.
The study of the CGM has gained increasing attention due to its ability to bridge the
gap between galaxies and the larger-scale structures of the IGM. Observationally, the CGM
is mainly probed using quasar sightlines just like the IGM, with the distinction that the the
intervening gas clouds in the CGM will produce Lyα along with other metal absorption lines
depending on the temperature. These observations provide critical insights into the physical
properties of the CGM, including its density, temperature, ionization state, and metallicity.

the large scale features of the CGM: hot and metal rich outflows coming out of a spiral
galaxy at the center while cold gas from the IGM is being accreted by the galaxy along the
filaments. All these inflows and outflows mix in the CGM to give it a complex multi-phase
structure. There is also a smaller satellite galaxy at the right bottom corner with adds to
the complexity. The multi-phase and turbulent nature of the CGM is shown in different
zoomed-in scales in the top two panels. Source: Faucher-Giguere and Oh (2023).
6

However, understanding the CGM is challenging due to the complexity of its structure
(Figure. 1.4) and the limitations of both observations and simulations. Theoretical models, particularly cosmological simulations and zoomed-in simulations of galaxies have been
instrumental in advancing our understanding of the CGM. These simulations incorporate
various physical processes, including gas cooling, star formation, and feedback mechanisms
from stars and AGN, allowing researchers to study the evolution of galaxies and their gaseous
environments in great detail.
1.4

Temperature-Density Relationship of the IGM and CGM

There is currently no clear definition of the extent of the CGM, meaning the boundary
at which the CGM ends and the IGM begins remains ambiguous. In theoretical studies,
the CGM is often defined as the gas within one virial radius of a galaxy’s halo, whereas
observationally, any gas with detectable metallicity is often attributed to the CGM. One of
the key distinguishing characteristics between the IGM and CGM is their distribution in
temperature-density phase space.

Figure 1.5 Left: Distribution of gas particles in the T − ρ plane in a snapshot of IllustrisTNG
Simulation. Right: Distribution of Lyα absorbing gas clouds in observation in the Column
Density-Line Width plane (refer to section 2.2.4). A positive Tmin − ρ correlation is seen in
both simulation and observations for the low density IGM. A negative correlation in higher
density clouds in the CGM is expected from the simulations. However observations are
inconclusive due to lack of data in the CGM.
Figure 1.5 summarizes our understanding of the temperature-density relationship of the
IGM and the CGM so far. To first order, the temperature in the IGM is tightly correlated
with gas density, a relationship commonly known as “the positive IGM temperature–density
(T–ρ) relation”, which follows a power law (Hui and Gnedin, 1997). This relation is governed
by a combination of Hubble expansion and heating from the extragalactic UV background.
7

Denser gas clouds are hotter since they are less affected by the Hubble flow, resulting in
a slower adiabatic cooling rate compared to lower-density gas. The slope of this power
law is expected to increase over time, barring additional heating mechanisms such as He II
reionization. In practice, this relation only defines a minimum temperature Tmin of the gas,
as gas can be further heated by processes such as gravitational shock heating to temperatures
well over 105 K (Cen and Ostriker, 1999). This positive (Tmin –ρ) correlation is well-supported
by observations and has been extensively studied over the last few decades (Schaye et al.,
2000; Rudie et al., 2012; Hiss et al., 2018).
In contrast, gas in the CGM near galaxies can experience additional heating due to galactic feedback and gravitational infall. However, as it is denser and more metal-rich on average,
CGM gas at 104 –105 K can cool radiatively. This results in a negative CGM Tmin –ρ relation,
with a redshift-dependent turnover separating the IGM from the CGM. Cosmological simulations of the assembly of dark and baryonic matter have predicted the existence of such a
relation for CGM gas (Davé et al., 2010; Peeples et al., 2010; Martizzi et al., 2019). However,
observational evidence for this relation remains lacking due to limited data. Observing the
CGM through QSO spectra requires sightlines that pass close to galaxies, which is relatively
rare. Additionally, absorption lines in Lyman-α from the CGM are often saturated due to
the higher gas density, making analysis of these lines challenging.
Given these observational limitations, cosmological simulations play a critical role in
exploring the complex physics of the CGM. We discuss this in the next section.
1.5

Cosmological Simulations

Cosmological simulations are essential tools for studying the evolution of large-scale structures, such as galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the IGM. These simulations model the complex
interplay of gravity, hydrodynamics, and feedback processes over billions of years in relatively
shorter time steps. To capture these dynamics across vastly different scales and densities,
cosmological simulations employ a range of computational techniques tailored to specific
research objectives.
The first cosmological simulations began by numerically solving a gravitational N-body
system (Press and Schechter, 1974), where a set number of particles are placed on a grid with
specified initial conditions, and their positions and momenta are updated at discrete time
steps according to Newton’s laws. Since then, substantial work has been done to incorporate
the effects of gas dynamics and star formation, leading to the development of hydrodynamical
simulations that include both dark matter and baryonic matter. This integration allows for
the modeling of not only gravitational interactions but also gas dynamics through methods
like Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and moving-mesh techniques, which capture
the fluid behavior of gas in the large scale structure.
Further advancements introduced subgrid models to represent small-scale processes that
cannot be directly resolved, such as star formation, supernova feedback, and black hole accretion. These models add critical astrophysical realism by simulating the feedback mechanisms
that regulate galaxy formation and evolution. Today’s simulations, combine these compu8

tational techniques with high-resolution producing increasingly accurate representations of
structure formation across cosmic time.
To illustrate these concepts, Figure 1.6 shows examples of simulation boxes at different
redshifts. These snapshots highlight how the large-scale structure of the universe evolves
over time, with dense regions forming clusters and filaments against a backdrop of diffuse
gas in cosmic voids.
1.5.1

Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics

One of the popular approaches for cosmological simulation is the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). SPH is a computational method used to simulate fluid dynamics, first
introduced by Lucy (1977) and Gingold and Monaghan (1977). SPH has become a widely
adopted approach in astrophysics, as well as fields like aerodynamics, oceanography, and
volcanology, due to its flexibility in handling highly dynamic and complex systems.
9

Figure 1.7 A visualization of a particle’s SPH convolution. A particle’s properties are
smoothed out over a region instead of being localized at one point. Source: Wikipedia.
In SPH, a fluid is represented by discrete particles, each carrying physical properties such
as mass, density, temperature, and velocity. Unlike mesh-based (Eulerian) methods, where
fluid properties are evaluated at fixed grid points in space, SPH is a Lagrangian approach:
particles move with the fluid flow. This allows SPH to adapt naturally to varying densities,
which is particularly useful for cosmological simulations where densities vary by orders of
magnitude between cosmic voids and galactic cores.
The properties of each particle are “smeared out” over a finite spatial range through
a kernel function W , which decreases monotonically with distance and vanishes beyond
a certain range, typically twice the particle’s smoothing length hSPH (Figure. 1.7). This
smoothing length varies based on local density, being smaller in dense regions and larger in
low-density areas. The kernel is often chosen to be a cubic spline, though other forms, like
Gaussian kernels, are also used.
The value A(r) of any quantity A at a position r is computed by summing over contributions from neighboring particles:
A(r) =

X mj Aj
j

ρj

W (|r − rj |, hSPH ),

(1.2)

where Aj , ρj , mj , and rj are the value, density, mass, and position of the j-th particle,
respectively, and the sum is taken over the nearest Nnb neighbors. The choice of Nnb depends
on the simulation, with values ranging from 30 to 100 particles commonly used.
Particle motions are determined by solving the Euler equations, including gravitational
and hydrodynamic forces. In SPH simulations that incorporate only dark matter, the only
relevant force is gravity. However, simulations of the intergalactic and circumgalactic media
10

include both dark matter particles and gas particles, allowing for the modeling of pressure
forces, shocks, and other hydrodynamic effects. In many SPH implementations, gravitational
forces between particles are softened to avoid numerical singularities, with the force between
particles i and j given by

SPH’s flexibility allows for the inclusion of various astrophysical processes, such as viscosity, star formation, chemical enrichment, and radiative transfer.
1.5.2

Particle-Mesh and Tree-Particle-Mesh Methods

In cosmological simulations, accurately modeling gravitational interactions among a vast
number of particles is essential, but also computationally challenging. Directly calculating
2
gravitational forces between all particle pairs scales as O(Npart
), where Npart is the number
of particles in the simulation. Such a scaling quickly becomes computationally infeasible
for the large particle counts typical of cosmological simulations. To address this, hybrid
methods like the Particle-Mesh (PM) and Tree-PM techniques are commonly used,
reducing computational complexity to approximately O(Npart (log Npart )) (Efstathiou et al.,
1985; Barnes and Hut, 1986).
The PM method uses a grid-based approach to calculate gravitational forces. In this
method, particles are first interpolated onto a regular spatial grid, where the mass density
at each grid point is calculated. The gravitational potential is then solved using Fourier
transforms to compute the potential across the entire grid efficiently. Once the gravitational
potential is determined, forces can be derived by taking gradients of the potential at each
grid point, and these forces are then interpolated back to individual particle positions. The
PM method is highly efficient for capturing long-range gravitational forces, making it ideal
for large-scale structure simulations where large distances need to be considered. However,
it has limited resolution at smaller scales due to the fixed grid, making it less accurate in
dense regions like galaxy clusters.
To enhance resolution on smaller scales, the Tree-PM Method combines the PM approach
with a hierarchical tree structure to handle gravitational forces at varying resolutions. In
Tree-PM, long-range forces are calculated using the PM method, while short-range forces
are computed by organizing particles into a hierarchical tree (such as an octree in 3D). In
this tree, particles that are spatially close are grouped into increasingly larger nodes as the
distance from the point of interest increases. For distant particles, the gravitational influence
is approximated by treating them as a single large mass located at the center of mass of their
group, while nearby particles are calculated individually (Figure. 1.8). This approach allows
for efficient calculations of both long-range and short-range interactions.
The Tree-PM method thus provides a good balance between efficiency and accuracy by
allowing high-resolution gravitational calculations where needed (e.g., within dense regions
such as galaxy clusters) while maintaining computational efficiency in lower-density regions.
11

Figure 1.8 A 2-D schematic diagram of the Tree-PM method. To compute the force on the
red particle on the top right corner, instead of separately calculating all the forces from the
23 particles, the particles are organized in the tree like on the right. The forces from the
particles in the grids away from the particles are approximated by the center of mass of all
the particles in the grid. Source: Link.

In SPH-based simulations, where both gas dynamics and gravitational interactions are critical, the Tree-PM approach is widely used to ensure accurate modeling of galaxy formation,
gas inflows and outflows, as well as the cosmic web.

1.5.3

Subgrid Physics

While cosmological simulations aim to model the large-scale structure of the universe, many
important astrophysical processes occur on scales below the resolution of these simulations.
For reference, the smallest particle mass achieved in a typical simulation is still approximately
a million times larger than the mass of the Sun. These small-scale, unresolved processes are
collectively referred to as subgrid physics. Subgrid models provide effective prescriptions for
phenomena such as star formation, feedback from supernovae and AGN, radiative cooling,
and chemical enrichment. By incorporating these processes, subgrid models enable simulations to better capture the evolution of galaxies, the interstellar medium (ISM), the CGM,
and, to some extent, the IGM.
12

Figure 1.9 AGN feedback observed in a galaxy cluster MS0735. The blue color shows the
hot Intracluster Medium (ICM) gas, and the red color shows the radio jets coming out of
the supermassive black hole.

Below, we provide an overview of the different subgrid physics included in a typical
cosmological simulation with baryonic physics. In Chapter 2, specific subgrid physics models
employed in the simulations used in this project will be discussed in detail.

Star Formation and Stellar Feedback
Star formation occurs on scales that are much smaller than the typical resolution of cosmological simulations, requiring subgrid models to approximate the conversion of gas into stars.
In most simulations, gas that reaches a certain density threshold and falls within a particular temperature range is eligible to form stars. Star formation rates are often governed by
empirical relations, such as the Kennicutt-Schmidt law (Kennicutt, 1998), which relates the
star formation rate to gas density.
Once stars form, they can influence their surroundings through stellar feedback, particularly through supernovae. Supernova feedback injects energy, momentum, and metals into
the surrounding gas, which can drive winds and turbulence in the CGM, regulate star formation, and enrich the IGM with metals. These feedback processes are crucial for maintaining
realistic galaxy evolution in simulations.
13

AGN Feedback
The centers of galaxies host supermassive black holes (SMBHs), that accrete matter from
their surroundings, as further discussed in Section 2.3. This accretion onto SMBHs can give
rise to galaxies having extremely bright central regions. AGN play a significant role in galaxy
evolution by injecting vast amounts of energy into the CGM and IGM. Subgrid models for
AGN feedback are essential for preventing excessive cooling and star formation in massive
galaxies. AGN feedback is typically implemented in two modes: a “quasar” mode, which
operates during high accretion phases, and a “radio” mode, which provides continuous,
lower-power heating to the CGM and IGM. This feedback heats and expels gas, creating
large-scale outflows and reducing gas inflows, thus affecting the density and temperature of
the CGM.

Radiative Cooling and Heating
Radiative cooling is another crucial subgrid process, as it determines how gas loses energy
and condenses into galaxies. Most simulations incorporate radiative cooling functions that
account for cooling from various elements, such as hydrogen, helium, and metals, under the
influence of a cosmic UV background. This cooling is counteracted by heating mechanisms,
including AGN and stellar feedback, which help maintain a balance and prevent overcooling
of the gas within galaxies and in the CGM.

Chemical Enrichment
Subgrid models for chemical enrichment track the production and distribution of heavy
elements generated by stellar nucleosynthesis and supernovae. As stars evolve and explode,
they release metals into the surrounding medium, enriching the ISM, CGM, and eventually
the IGM nearby galaxies. This enrichment affects the cooling rates of gas and has a direct
impact on galaxy formation and evolution.

Limitations
While subgrid models enable simulations to incorporate essential astrophysical processes,
they are inherently approximate and often rely on empirically determined parameters. Improving the accuracy of these models and aligning them more closely with observational data
remains an ongoing challenge in cosmology. One of the primary goals of this PhD project is
to evaluate the effectiveness of current subgrid models and explore potential improvements to
enhance the realism and predictive power of cosmological simulations. Future advancements
in computational power and access to high-resolution, large observational datasets will likely
drive refinements in subgrid modeling, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the
smaller scales.

Research Questions and Objectives

The primary goal of this research is to evaluate the properties of the CGM in cosmological
simulations and compare them with observational data, focusing on key physical properties,
especially on the Tmin –ρ relationship. By incorporating a larger observational dataset and by
studying the CGM in simulations with various baryonic physics, this study seeks to answer
the following questions:
• How accurately do cosmological simulations represent the CGM around galaxies of
different masses and in the reshift range 0 < z < 4?
• What is the impact of feedback processes on the properties of the CGM, and how do
these effects vary across different galaxy populations?
• Is it possible to quantify the effect of feedback processes on the turbulence and ionization state of the CGM gas?
• Can the CGM Tmin –ρ relation seen in simulations be detected in observations?
• If detected, what is the exact form of this relation?
• How big is the extent of the CGM around galaxies and how does it evolve with redshift?
Through a detailed analysis of these questions, the research aims to bridge the gap between
simulations and observations, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the CGM and
its role in galaxy evolution.

CHAPTER 2
METHODOLOGY
2.1

Observational Data

The QSO spectra available to us can be divided into two categories, viz., low-redshift data
(z<0.5) and high-redshift data (2<z<4). As the Lyman series falls into the UV range, it
requires a space telescope to observe the Lyα forest. So far, we do not have a suitable
telescope to observe the Lyα forest in the intermediate redshift range of 0.5<z<2. Below we
discuss the database we use for our observational analysis.

Table 2.1 summarizes the QSO spectra data that is available to us. At hight redshift,
we have the publicly available HIRES (High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer) QSO spectra taken from the Keck Observatory Archive and UVES (Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle
Spectrograph) QSO spectra from the ESO (European Southern Observatory) Archive. We
will use suitable HIRES spectra from the KODIAQ (Keck Observatory Database of Ionized Absorption toward Quasars) project (O’Meara et al., 2015) and UVES spectra from
the SQUAD (Spectra Quasar Absorption Database) project (Murphy et al., 2019). At low
redshift, we also have ∼ 500 HST/COS spectra publicly available from the HSLA (Hubble
Spectra Legacy Archive) project (Peeples et al., 2017). Although the majority of these QSO
spectra are taken to study Damped Lyman α (DLA) systems, many sightlines provide a
long wavelength coverage sufficient for our analysis. So far we have data from analysis of
∼100 spectra. For ground-based telescopes (VLT and Keck) information on Lyα absorbers
in the spectra of the QSOs is restricted by the atmospheric cutoff at ∼3050 Å, meaning that
absorbers at z ≤ 1.5 can not detected from the ground. At the HIRES and UVES resolution
of ∼7 km s−1 , HI is fully resolved and among metal absorption lines CIV and SiIV lines are
resolved so that a reliable absorption line parameter can be obtained using profile fitting via
the code VPFIT (Section 2.2.4).
17

2.2

Line Profile Analysis

In high resolution spectra (FWHM <25 kms−1 ), it is possible to resolve individual absorption
lines in the Ly-α forest. This section will discuss the theory and methods used for our
absorption line profile analysis.
2.2.1

Optical Depth

The optical depth (τ ) is a measure of the absorption strength at a specific wavelength and
is fundamental to understanding the absorption features in the Lyα forest. In the context of
absorption lines, optical depth quantifies the likelihood that photons are absorbed as they
pass through an absorbing medium—in this case, neutral hydrogen in the IGM.
As shown in Figure 2.1, consider a beam of light of wavelength near to that of Lyα, with
an initial intensity I0 , passing through a homogeneous cloud with neutral hydrogen (HI)
number density nHI . Let us assume that the cross-section of a single HI atom is σ. In reality,
this cross-section will be more like a probability distribution of the electron cloud around
the nucleus. When the light travels through an infinitesimal distance of dl, the change in
intensity would be,

Figure 2.1 A beam of light passing through a cylinder of absorbers. Photon gets absorbed
as it hits an absorber.

dI = −I0 nHI σdl.

(2.1)

dτ ≡ nHI σdl.

(2.2)

We define

Then, integrating eq.2.1 along the path of the light gives us
Iout = I0 e−τ

(2.3)

As optical depth gets larger, the amount of light transmitted drops exponentially. When
τ < 1, the gas is considered to be optically thin or transparent and when τ ≫ 1, the gas is
considered to be optically thick, or opaque.
18

2.2.2

Line Broadening

Ideally, spectral absorption lines occur at the resonant frequency, where the frequency is
related to the energy difference between the two energy states of the electron via
(Ei − Ef ) = hν.

(2.4)

However, in reality the absorption (or emission) lines are never monochromatic in observations. There are several reasons for this. A few common line broadening mechanisms
outlined below are: natural line broadening, Doppler broadening, collision broadening and
instrumental broadening.

Figure 2.2 Visualization of uncertainty in ν from Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.
Natural broadening of an absorption line profile originates from Heisenberg’s uncertainty
principle:
∆E∆t ≥ ℏ/2,

(2.5)

where ∆E is the uncertainty in the energy of the state and ∆t is the uncertainty in
the occupation time of the state (∝ half-life). Due to this the absorption line spreads from
looking like a Dirac delta function to a line profile with a shape given by a Lorentzian
distribution of the form:
∆νN /2
L(ν) =
,
(2.6)
(ν − ν0 )2 + (∆νN /2)2
where ν0 is the resonant frequency of the transition and ∆νN = 2π/t1/2 is called the natural
line width corresponding to that transition. Eq. 2.6 can be derived by considering the
electron-proton system as a classical damped harmonic oscillator in the small damping regime
(∆νN ≪ ν0 ).
Another source of absorption line broadening is the thermal/Doppler broadening which
originates from the temperature of a gas cloud. At a temperature T, the thermal velocities
19

of individual gas particles follow the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Hence the thermal
velocity dispersion is
r
2kB T
vth =
,
(2.7)
m
where kB is the Boltzmann constant, and m is the mass of an individual gas atom. This distribution in velocity also means that the absorption line from the gas cloud will by smoothened
due to Doppler shift. So, the line width associated with the Doppler broadening would be
vth
ν0 .
(2.8)
∆νD =
c
We write the expression for line profile broadening in terms of this Doppler width(∆νD ) as
1 −( ν−ν0 )2
G(ν) = √ e ∆νD
π

(2.9)

Apart from the two processes above, observed absorption lines can be further smoothed
by collisions and turbulence in the gas, as well as by the line spread function (LSF) of
the instrument itself. The latter can be easily accounted for by knowing the LSF of the
instrument in a controlled environment.
Line widths from collisions, again follows a Lorentzian profile since the inelastic collisions
can be seen as changes in energy states as in the case of natural broadening. So to the total
width of the Lorentzian profile due to both of these factors would be
∆νL = ∆νN + ∆νcoll.

(2.10)

Meanwhile, depending on the velocity distribution, the smoothing due to turbulence can
be either Gaussian or non-Gaussian. Since the actual mechanism of the turbulence is not
understood in detail, any excess spread in the absorption line width is attributed to nonthermal processes through a single parameter (discussed in 2.2.4).
2.2.3

Voigt Profile

Accounting for the factors in the previous subsection, the overall profile of an absorption
line would be a combination of the Lorentzian and the Gaussian profiles. This is given by
the Voigt profile, named after a German physicist Woldemar Voigt.
First, for simplification, we define the following variable:
x≡

is the Voigt-Hjerting function (Hjerting, 1938). Eq. 2.15 gives the overall normalized line
profile of an absorption line. To get the absorption cross-section (eq.2.2), we need to multiply
it by a proportionality constant which can be derived from dispersion theory of electromagnetic waves in an absorbing medium. Then we will have,

where NHI = nHI dl is the column density of neutral hydrogen integrated along the line

characterizing each absorber by the column density and the line width. The resultant profile
combine properties of both Lorentzian and Gaussian profiles as shown in Figure 2.3.
2.2.4

VPFIT: Voigt Profile Fitting for Absorption Line Analysis

To analyze the Lyman-alpha forest and other absorption features in quasar spectra, we use
VPFIT, a Voigt profile fitting software developed by Carswell and Webb (2014). VPFIT
is widely adopted for precision analysis of absorption lines. VPFIT allows us to decompose
complex absorption spectra into individual Voigt profiles, which describe the shape of absorption lines due to a combination of Doppler and natural broadening effects. By fitting
these profiles, we can determine the physical properties of the gas along the line of sight, such
as column densities, temperatures, and turbulent velocities, enabling detailed comparisons
between simulated and observed spectra.
VPFIT iteratively adjusts parameters such as the central wavelength, column density,
and Doppler broadening parameter until it finds an optimal fit for each absorption feature.
21

Profile. Credits: Demtröder (2008).
This process enables the precise extraction of gas properties from each fitted line. The key
parameters obtained through VPFIT fitting include:
- Column Density (NHI ): Represents the amount of neutral hydrogen along the line
of sight for each absorption feature. The usual unit for column density fits from VPFIT is
log10 (NHI /cm−2 ).
- Doppler Parameter (b): A measure of the line width, which can indicate thermal
motion (temperature) and small-scale turbulence within the absorbing gas. The unit of b
from VPFIT is in kms−1 and is given by eq. 2.7 plus any width contribution from nonthermal motion.

(2.20)

Note that the contribution of non-thermal motion to the line width can be found if we fit
absorption lines of two different species (e.g., HI and CIV) coming from the same gas cloud
assuming that both species are at the same temperature and have the same non-thermal
velocity distribution within that gas cloud.
- Redshift (z): The redshift of each absorption feature reveals the relative velocity and
distance of the gas, allowing for the reconstruction of large-scale structure along the sightline.
An example of fitted absorption lines can be seen in Figure 2.4. For this project, VPFIT is applied to synthetic spectra generated from cosmological simulations, as well as to
observational spectra of quasars. By comparing the fitted column densities and Doppler pa22

rameters in both datasets, we aim to assess how well the simulations replicate the observed
properties of the IGM and the CGM.
While VPFIT provides highly accurate fits to absorption lines, there are uncertainties
associated with the decomposition of blended lines, especially in regions with saturated absorption. These uncertainties can affect the inferred column densities and temperatures,
potentially biasing comparisons between simulations and observations. To mitigate these effects, this study includes error analysis on fitted parameters and cross-checks with alternative
fitting techniques when possible.
2.3

Cosmological Simulations to be Analyzed during this PhD Thesis

The core of this research involves the use of large-scale cosmological simulations to study
the CGM and its relationship with galaxies. Two primary simulations are employed: the
Sherwood simulations and the Illustris-TNG simulation suite, described below. Both simulations model the formation and evolution of structures in the universe, but with different
emphases on physical processes and resolutions.
2.3.1

The Sherwood Simulations

The Sherwood Simulation suite (Bolton et al., 2017) is a collection of high resolution hydrodynamical simulations to study the diffuse gas in the universe. The simulations are
performed at different resolutions, and of particular interest for this thesis, implement a
variety of feedback physics including models for galactic outflows such as stellar wind and
23

AGN feedback. Table 2.2 lists the simulations which are currently being used in our work;
further entries will be added as our work progresses.
The simulations are based on the code P-GADGET-3 with modifications applied for different physics for different simulation boxes. P-GADGET-3 is a Tree-PM SPH code and
it is an updated and extended version of the publicly available code GADGET-2 (Galaxies
with dark matter and gas interact) published in Springel (2005). The cosmological parameters used in the models is obtained from Planck Collaboration et al. (2014), where
Ωm = 0.308, ΩΛ = 0.692, h = 0.678, Ωb = 0.0482, σ8 = 0.829, and n = 0.961.1 A primordial helium fraction of Yp = 0.24 is assumed. The initial conditions are generated at the
redshift of z = 99 on a regular grid using transfer functions generated by CAMB (Code
of Anisotropies in Microwave background; Lewis et al. (2000)). The SPH parameters are
Nnb = 64 and lsoft = 1/25th of mean inter-particle spacing (∼ 1 − 2 h−1 cMpc).
The simulations used in this project (Table 2.2) are performed in two different box sizes:
40 h−1 cMpc and 60 h−1 cMpc, with the smaller ones having higher resolution than the larger
ones. The 60 h−1 cMpc boxes have four variants of subgrid physics and have outputs at
z < 2.6, while the 40 h−1 cMpc boxes have only two variants of subgrid physics and have
outputs at z > 2. At each resolution we have a “no feedback” variant, which does not
implement any subgrid physics. In these runs, gas particles with temperature T< 105 K and
overdensity ∆(= ρ/ρcrit ) > 103 are converted into collisonless star particles.2 On the other
hand, the runs with subgrid physics are: “Only stellar wind”, “Stellar wind + AGN
feedback”, and “Stellar wind + Strong AGN feedback”. For the higher resolution
boxes, the only run with subgrid physics is the Stellar Wind + AGN run. The boxes of the
same size have the same initial conditions, and hence have the same large scale structures
for one to one comparison.
The Wind Model
The subgrid physics models used in these simulations are taken from the model S15 in
(Puchwein and Springel, 2013). The velocity of the wind coming out of a galaxy is taken to
be directly proportional to the escape velocity of the galaxy:
vw = κ × vesc ,

(2.21)

where κ = 0.6 is the constant of proportionality which fits best with the observations. The
escape velocity vesc of the galaxies is calculated assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)

where c is the concentration parameter of the halo, rs is the NFW scale radius, r200c is
the radius at which the mean enclosed density of the halo is 200ρcrit , M200c is the total mass
enclosed by r200c , and v200c is the circular velocity at r200c .
The amount of gas entering into the wind is taken from Springel and Hernquist (2003),
where the energy available for the wind particles is proportional to the star formation rate
(Ṁ∗ ) and supernova fraction (ϵSN ):
1
Ṁw vw2 ∝ ϵSN Ṁ∗
(2.25)
2
In galactic wind models, the mass loading factor defined by η ≡ Ṁw /Ṁ∗ is of particular
importance. In our case, where the galactic winds are driven by energy, the mass loading
factor scales as η ∼ vw−2 . So larger halos will have a significantly larger fraction of mass
outflows, and thereby suppress star formation to a greater extent compared to smaller halos.
The AGN feedback model
Also taken from Puchwein and Springel (2013), the AGN feedback models seed supermassive
blackholes (BHs) of mass mBH,seed = 104 h−1 M⊙ into the centers of halos when they exceed
5 × 1010 h−1 M⊙ . The BH particles are treated as collisonless sink particles that grow with gas
accretion and by merging with other BH particles (Sijacki et al., 2007). Two BH particles
are merged when they are within their SPH smoothing scale and have velocities smaller than
the local sound speed. For simplicity, the BH particles are re-centered to the minimum of
the potential well of the halo at every time step.
25

As mentioned in Chapter 1, the AGN feedback is divided into two modes: ‘quasar mode’
and ‘radio mode’. This is motivated from both theory and observations such as Gallo et al.
(2003); Croton et al. (2006). These modes are dependent on the accretion rate of the BH.
The accretion rate of a BH particle is calculated using the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton formula:
ṀBH =

2
4παG2 MBH
ρ
,
2
2
3/2
(cs + v )

(2.26)

where α is a dimentionless parameter used to boost the accretion rate, ρ is the local density,
cs is the local sound speed of the gas, v is the velocity of the BH relative to the gas (v = 0
in our case). An upper limit for the accretion is also imposed in the simulations to be equal
to the Eddington limit:
4πGMBH mp
,
(2.27)
ṀEdd =
ϵr σT c
where mp is the proton mass, σT is the Thompson cross-section and ϵr is the radiative
efficiency assumed to be equal to 0.1.
The quasar mode is active when the accretion rates are high (ṀBH > 0.01 × ṀEdd ). In
this regime, BHs accrete efficiently and power luminous quasar activity where only a very
small fraction of the luminosity thermally couples to the surrounding medium. In both
wind+AGN and wind+strongAGN models 0.5 per cent of the accreted rest mass energy is
thermally coupled to the surrounding gas.
At lower accretion rates (ṀBH < 0.01× ṀEdd ), AGN heating happens through radiatively
inefficient feedback in a mostly mechanical form. This is realized in the simulation by
injecting bubbles into the host galaxy/cluster triggered by a fractional increase in the BH
mass. In the wind+AGN model, a fractional increase (δMBH ) in the black hole mass of
104 , with 2% of the rest mass energy used for injecting hot AGN bubbles. Whereas, for
the wind+strongAGN model, δMBH is increased to 10−2 , with 8% energy being used to
inject AGN bubbles. This leads to a less frequent but stonger bubble injection, resulting in
significantly less gas fraction nearby halos.
2.3.2

The IllustrisTNG Simulations

The IllustrisTNG (The Next Generation) simulation suite (Springel et al., 2018) is a set of
state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations designed to model accurate subgrid
physics. This suite builds on the original Illustris project (Vogelsberger et al., 2014), with
updates in feedback physics, improved resolution, and a refined cosmological model. Table
2.3 lists the specific IllustrisTNG simulations used in this project, detailing the box sizes,
resolution, and available redshift snapshots.
The simulations are performed using the AREPO code (Weinberger et al., 2020), a
moving-mesh hydrodynamics solver that combines the strengths of SPH and traditional
grid-based methods. AREPO’s moving-mesh approach provides greater accuracy in modeling gas dynamics across a wide range of densities, making it particularly effective for

with Ωm = 0.31, ΩΛ = 0.69, h = 0.677, Ωb = 0.0486, σ8 = 0.8159, and ns = 0.97.
Box Sizes, Resolution, and Redshift Coverage
The IllustrisTNG suite includes three main box sizes—TNG50, TNG100, and TNG300—which
vary in both volume and resolution. These boxes cover a range of cosmic scales, enabling
studies of everything from detailed galaxy evolution to large-scale cosmic web structure:
1. TNG50: This box spans 50 Mpc per side and has the highest resolution, with particle
masses of 8.5 × 104 M⊙ for baryons. It is ideal for detailed studies of small-scale galactic
structures and CGM properties, particularly at low redshifts.
2. TNG100: Spanning 100 Mpc per side, this intermediate-resolution box provides a
balance between computational efficiency and physical detail, with baryonic particle masses
of 1.4 × 106 M⊙ . TNG100 is well-suited for studying galaxy evolution and CGM dynamics
across a range of redshifts.
3. TNG300: The largest box, at 300 Mpc per side, TNG300 is optimized for capturing
large-scale structure and the evolution of massive galaxy clusters. With baryonic particle
masses of 1.1 × 107 M⊙ , it is less detailed on small scales but highly effective for large-scale
statistical studies.
Each of these runs includes a total of 100 snapshots3 in the redshift range of 0 ≤ z ≤ 20,
allowing for evolutionary studies from early times up to the present day. This broad redshift
coverage is essential for analyzing how the CGM and IGM evolve in response to galactic
feedback processes over cosmic time.
Subgrid Physics Models
IllustrisTNG incorporates a range of subgrid models that capture critical astrophysical processes, including star formation, stellar feedback, black hole growth, and AGN feedback.

A snapshot is defined as all the data of a simulation box at a specific redshift.

27

These models are designed to reproduce observed properties of galaxies, such as their stellar
mass, gas content, and metallicity.
1. Stellar Feedback: Instead of scaling the wind velocity with the escape velocity, the
TNG suite implements the stellar feedback model where vw scales with the the local, onedimensional DM velocity dispersion (σDM ). They also set a minimum wind velocity injection

where H0 and H(z) are the present day Hubble constant and the Hubble parameter at redshift
zrespectively. More details can be found in Vogelsberger et al. (2013) and Pillepich et al.
(2017).
2. Black Hole Accretion and Feedback: In TNG, BH particles of mass 8×105 h−1 M⊙
are seeded into halos above the mass 5×1010 h−1 M⊙ . The accretion rates are calculated using
2.26, but without the boosting factor α. Similar to Sherwood, TNG also implements AGN
feedback in two different modes. The accretion rate threshold for differentiating between
high/low accretion mode now scales with the BH mass,

In high accretion quasar mode 2% of the rest mass energy of the accreted gas is injected
into the gas surrounding the BH in the form thermal energy. In the low accretion mode,
a kinetic BH-driven wind is implemented in place of the bubble model. In this mode, the
energy is injected into wind particles as pure kinetic energy instead of thermal energy. The
fraction of energy injected this way is kept at < 2%, however this is also density dependent
to make sure that such winds do not drive the gas density to an unrealistically low values in
low density halos. More details can be found in Weinberger et al. (2017).
3. Magnetic Fields and Other Subgrid Physics: IllustrisTNG is one of the first
large-scale cosmological simulations to include a full magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) treatment, allowing for the evolution of cosmic magnetic fields. This addition enables a more
realistic model of gas dynamics and pressure support in the CGM, particularly in dense
regions around galaxies.
IllustrisTNG also includes detailed models for radiative cooling, including metal-line
cooling and photoionization by a uniform UV background (Haardt and Madau, 2012). The
metal enrichment model tracks multiple species (e.g., Fe, O, C) produced by supernovae
and stellar winds, enriching the gas over time. This enriched gas can cool more efficiently,
influencing the formation of subsequent generations of stars and altering the CGM’s thermal
properties.
Although only one kind of subgrid physics model is applied in the all the simulation
runs, the richness of the physics and large redshift coverage make IllustrisTNG a versatile
28

tool for studying the CGM and IGM. TNG50’s high resolution allows for detailed studies
of small-scale CGM structure, while TNG100 and TNG300 provide a statistical approach
to large-scale structure and galaxy evolution. By comparing results across different runs, it
is possible to analyze how stellar and AGN feedback influence gas properties, metallicity,
and density in the CGM over cosmic time, providing insights into the relationship between
galaxies and their gaseous halos. For comparison with the 60cMPc boxes of Sherwood, we
will mainly focus on the simulation TNG100 (75cMpc) in this project.
2.4

Simulation Data Analysis

We analyze the simulation data with two approaches. First, to compare the Lyα forest statistics in observation, we shoot lines of sight (LOSs) across the simulation boxes at thousands
of random locations. We obtain several physical properties of the gas along these LOSs such
as density, temperature, metallicity, HI fraction, peculiar velocity, etc. Most importantly, we
also obtain the optical depth for different absorption lines along the LOS. From the optical
depth, we create thousands of mock spectra which would be equavalent to QSO spectra
in observations. The second approach focuses more on the halos, where we target specific
isolated galaxies and look at the properties of these targets at different redshifts.
2.4.1

Mock Spectra from Simulation

The method for extracting LOS spectra from the simulation boxes follows from Theuns et al.
(1998). We divide the LOS into bins of npix = 2048 pixels of width ∆ along the sightline.
Using eq. 1.2, with a weight factor indicating the fractional abundance of the species (HI
fraction for Lyα), we compute the density ρX , density-weighted temperature (ρT )X and
density-weighted velocity (ρv)X at each bin. Once we have these values, we calculate the
optical depth in each bin by using eq. 2.19. We convert eq. 2.19 to wavelength space from
frequency space for convenience:
τλ = σ α √

cNX
H(a, x),
π∆λD

(2.30)

where σα is the cross-section, NX = ρX ∆ is the column density of the species, and ∆λD
is the Doppler width of the species in wavlength space with the temperature information
inside.
For Lyα, the cross-section is σα = (3πσT /8)1/2 fLyα λ0 = 4.45 × 10−18 cm2 , with oscillator
strength fLyα = 0.41615, the Thomson cross-section σT = 6.625 × 10−25 cm2 , and the rest
wavelength corresponding to resonant frequency of Lyα λ0 = 1215.67Å. The calculated
optical depth can then be redshifted to the observed wavelength using the relation
λ = λ0 (1 + z)(1 + v/c),
where v is the peculiar velocity.
29

(2.31)

The HI optical depth is then rescaled according the mean observed flux using a power
law from Kim et al. (2007)
eff
= 0.0023 ± (1 + z)3.65 .
(2.32)
τHI
The optical depth is then converted into flux using eq. 2.3. For a better comparison
with the observed spectra, the extracted spectra are convolved with an appropriate LSF
(FWHM∼7kms−1 ) and a gaussian noise with an appropriate S/N (∼100). Once all the
post-processing steps are done, the spectra are fitted using VPFIT as described in Section
2.2.4.
2.4.2

Individual Galaxy halos in Simulation

To investigate the CGM around galaxies, we look at halos of isolated galaxies in different
mass ranges. For IllustriTNG, we do this using the publicly available Group and Subhalo
catalogues which are obtained using the Subfind algorithm (Springel et al., 2001). A merger
tree of subhalos for each simulation run is also available using which each galaxy can by
tracked at different snapshots. For the Sherwood simulations, we run the ROCKSTAR
(Robust Overdensity Calculation using K-Space Topologically Adaptive Refinement) halo
finder algorithm (see Behroozi et al. (2013) for more details) on all the available snapshots.
Obtaining a merger-tree is not possible since the available snapshots are too far apart in
time. So a halo is tracked in a different snapshot by searching for a halo with appropriate
mass ratio (given the approximate growth rate of structure) inside an appropriate region
along with visual inspection.
In the next Chapter, we discuss the results we have obtained so far using the methods
described in Chapter 2.

30

CHAPTER 3
PRELIMINARY RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
So far, we have been analyzing the simulation boxes at two redshifts: z=0.1 and z=2.4,
considering only the TNG100-1 and Sherwood 60cMpc simulations. In this chapter, we
discuss our preliminary findings from our analysis.

3.1

Individual Halo Analysis

We start by looking at the properties of the gas around the same halo in different feedback
regimes. For this we make 2-D projected plots of gas density, temperature, HI column
density, etc. in the regions around halos to visually investigate any differences.
To do this, we first obtain the halo catalogues of all the simulation boxes either using
the Illustis API for TNG or running ROCKSTAR on the Sherwood snapshots. Once we
have the halo catalogues, we bin the halos according to their mass in several bins such as
1010.75 −1011.25 , 1011.75 −1012.25 , 1012.75 −1013.25 M⊙ , etc. Since our project focuses on the cold
CGM, we avoid halos hosting groups/clusters of galaxies. Such halos host hot gas (T > 106 K)
in the ICM which we cannot observe in the Lyα forest. Soft X-ray telescopes/spectroscopes
are needed to observe such gas. Keeping this in mind, we search for isolated galaxies. This
is done by comparing the mass of the halo to any other satellite halo nearby. If no other halo
of significant mass is present within an appropriate distance, i.e., no massive substructure is
present within the galaxy halo, we select that halo for our analysis.

3.1.1

Gas Density

In Figure 3.1, we show the projected gas density of a halo in different feedback physics. The
upper panels shows a halo of mass ∼ 1011 M⊙ and the lower panels show a halo of mass
∼ 1012 M⊙ . Note that the two halos in the upper and lower panel are different as we are still
trying to figure out the best way to track a halo in different snapshots since the snapshots
available from Sherwood simulations are far apart, unlike TNG.
At z=2.4, we do see a difference in gas mass in the halo in the No feedback run compared
to the run with subgrid physics. This is because without any outflows, star formation rate is
much higher and the halo runs out of gas very rapidly by forming stars. However, the gas is
seem to be insensitive to AGN feedback, as small halos like these do not have a supermassive
black hole (SMBH) powerful enough to have an impact on the gas.
In contrast, the halo at z=0.1 looks significantly different in each simulation. The halo
with no feedback has less gas than the one with only stellar wind due to the reasons mentioned
above. However, when AGN feedback is turned on, we see that a substantial amount of gas
has escaped to outside of the virial radius (Rvir ) of the halo. This effect is very prominent in
the strong AGN feedback run where virtually no gas is left inside the halo. We will investigate
31

Figure 3.1 Projected gas density of a halo in four different feedback physics of Sherwood
simulations. The mass of the halo at z=2.4 is ∼ 1011 M⊙ , and z=0.01 is ∼ 1012 M⊙ . The
cyan circle represents the virial radius of the dark matter halo. We see that at higher
redshifts, AGN feedback is not significantly changing the gas distribution but as we come to
lower redshift, the stronger AGN feedback drives almost all of the gas out of the halo region.

this effect further, to see if lower redshift CGM observations can be used to constrain the
strength of AGN feedback in the universe.
A similar plot for a halo in TNG100-1 as seen in Figure 3.2. With much higher resolution
and superior subgrid physics, we can see much finer substructure in the galaxy including
the spiral arms. Direct visual comparison with the Sherwood halos is not possible. For

comparison, further analyses such as looking at radial profiles, statistics of several halos in
a mass bin needed.

3.1.2

Temperature

We also look at the effect of the feedback process on the gas temperature surrounding halos.
The right panels of Fig. 3.3 show the gas temperature of the same halo in no feedback and
wind+AGN simulation at z=0.1. The difference is more visible further away from the halo
where gas temperature is higher with feedback compared to no feedback. Note that the
leftmost panels shows the location of the halo in the cosmic web where we can see the gas is
more diffuse in the wind+AGN box.
A closer look at the gas temperature is done by filtering out gases in different temperature
bins. We plot 2-D gas density of the gas in three temperature bins: 103.5 −104 K, 104 −104.5 K,
104.5 − 105 K. In Figure 3.4, see the difference more clearly. In the wind+AGN halo, almost
no gas is present in the lowest temperature bin near the center of the halo, while relatively
little gas is present in the intermediate bin. In the 104.5 − 105 K bin however, we see more
gas, which tells us that AGN feedback is heating up the CGM which could potentially make
this gas too ionized to be observable in Lyα absorption.
33

Figure 3.4 Gas density map around the halo in fig. 3.3, in three different temperature bins.
The white region implies there is no gas in that temperature bin inside that region.
We also examine the distribution of the gas in the temperature density plane. Fig. 3.5
shows the correlation between temperature and density in the vicinity of the halo in Fig.
3.1 at z=2.4. At this redshift, gas is not as hot as the previous example at z=0.1. We can
clearly see the negative correlation between temperature and density where the densest gas
is also the coldest due to radiative cooling. The right hand panels shows the column density
of HI which tells us that the gas in the outer CGM should be seen in Lyα absorption. This is
shown in figure 3.6, where we shoot an LOS at an impact parameter of 0.75Rvir . A saturated
Lyα absorption line is seen in the extracted spectrum. Targeted LOSs such as this one would
be helpful in understanding how CGM should look like in observed QSO spectra. In future,
we also plan to look at metal absorption lines coming from these gas clouds by predicting the
metal abundance present in the gas clouds using the prescriptions contained in the CLOUDY
code (Chatzikos et al., 2023) and calculating optical depths for metal species such as CIV
and SIV along the LOS.

3.2

Statistical Analysis

In our statistical approach which is more relevant for comparison with observed data, we
shoot thousands of LOSs in each simulation box and extract spectra along them. The details
of this method are in section 2.4. So far we have 16384 lines per Sherwood snapshot in Table
34

hydrogen in the halo. The negative T − ρ relationship can be clearly seen in all the plots

simulation at z=2.4. The yellow arrow in the upper panel shows the position and direction
of the line of sight with respect to the halo. The LOS has an impact parameter of 0.75Rvir
from the center of the halo. The absorption line is well saturated as expected from a dense
gas cloud in the CGM. This is the same halo shown in Figs. 3.1 and 3.5.

2.2 readily available as part of on the fly LOS extraction in the Sherwood run. We have
also extracted 5000 random LOSs for TNG100-1 at z=0.1. These spectra are fitted using
the automatic fitting feature in VPFIT which gives us a list of column density and Doppler
width b values for all of the absorbers along these LOSs. The temperature and density
in the initial LOS file is volume-weighted which is not desirable for studying absorbers in
CGM as the values would be dominated by low density (higher volume) regions. So, once
we obtain the optical depth, we also compute the optical depth-weighted temperature and
density along the LOS (Figure 3.7).
36

Figure 3.8 Distribution of 6000 absorbers in N-b plane (top) and T-ρ plane (bottom) at z=0.1
for no feedback (Left), wind+AGN (middle) and wind+strongAGN (Right) simulation runs.
After this we investigate the distribution of the absorbers in the NHI-b plane, as well
as the T-ρ plane. Figure 3.8 shows the preliminary results of such an analysis at z=0.1.
We see that the distribution of the absorbers for different feedback physics is significantly
different. Without any feedback there is no high density gas cloud as the cold dense gas has
already been accreted by the galaxies to form stars and the hot gas is not detectable via
the Lyα forest. The gas in wind+AGN run seems promising as the turnover is clear in the
T-ρ plane and we can also see a hint of a turn over in the N-b plane. Further analysis such
as fitting a power-law and how the turnover evolves with redshift is required for a better
understanding. The gas in the wind+strongAGN run on the other hand is widely distributed
along the vertical (temperature) axis and very few absorbers are in the high density+cold
temperature region. However we do see a turnover and it should be more visible as we fit
more spectra. We also need to investigate how different the T-ρ relation is compared to the
wind+AGN run. In contrast, at z=2.4, Figure 3.9 shows little difference between the no
feedback and wind+strongAGN run. This is consistent with what we saw in our individual
halo analyses.

LOSs at z=2.4 in the Sherwood No feedback (left) and wind+strongAGN (right) runs. The
wind+strongAGN absorbers seem to have a significantly wider distribution along the b-axis
which is expected from a hotter IGM. However, in the CGM region, number of absorbers is
still very sparse. A similar analysis needed by targeting LOSs nearby galaxies to investigate
this region further.

CHAPTER 4
TIMELINE AND FUTURE WORK
In conclusion, we return to the questions posed in Chapter 1 focusing on those that my PhD
will address. We summarize progress so far, and outline future work. We summarize an
additional project not included in the proposal, note publications and presentations to date,
and present a timeline of anticipated milestones.
4.1

Work to date and future work
• How accurately do cosmological simulations represent the CGM around
galaxies of different masses and in the reshift range 0 < z < 4?
So far, I have obtained spectra on random LOSs for two redshift bins for each of the
Sherwood (for each physics) and IllustrisTNG simulations. At low redshift, out of
16,000 LOSs/ box, all have been fitted using VPFIT to obtain the column density and
linewidth of the absorbers. I will obtain spectra on random LOSs for at least three
additional redshift bins per Sherwood physics, and for IllustrisTNG-100, and carry out
profile fitting analysis.
My Co-advisor Dr. Kim is analyzing new spectroscopic data, making a larger observational sample with more absorbers at CGM column densities. We will then statistically
compare the properties of absorbers seen in simulations with those seen in the universe.
• What is the impact of feedback processes on the properties of the CGM,
and how do these effects vary across different galaxy populations?
I have obtained examples of targeted spectra on LOSs at specific impact parameters
around around halos, and fit absorption profiles.
As a function of impact parameter and halo mass bin, I will obtain and fit samples of
targeted spectra - of order 1000 per box, to be determined. This will be carried out
for the two current redshifts under consideration and at least three additional ones as
outlined in the point above.
This will allow a detailed comparison of line profiles as a function of galaxy mass,
impact parameter and implemented subgrid physics.
• Is it possible to quantify the effect of feedback processes on the turbulence
and ionization state of the CGM gas?
To look at the effect of turbulence, we need to compute the non-thermal velocities
in the gas clouds. To imitate observations, where turbulence is computed using eq.
2.20 by comparing the line-width of two different species in the same gas cloud, I
will calculate metal abundance in the Sherwood simulations. I will then extract metal
absorption lines similar to HI absorption lines and calculate bnon−thermal from comparing
39

HI and absorption lines. This analysis will then be compared to similar analysis in
observations.
• How big is the extent of the CGM around galaxies and how does it evolve
with redshift?
Once we detect a CGM Tmin -ρ cutoff relation, we will try different fitting algorithms
similar to Rudie et al. (2012) to fit the cutoff relation. We plan to come up of our
own algorithm if none of the already existing ones work. Using both Tmin -ρ relation
in the IGM and the CGM we will define a turnover point in the the T-ρ plane which
will effectively define the extent of CGM. We will also investigate how the CGM size
evolves with time by doing the same analysis at different redshifts.

Application of Machine Learning

In collaboration with Sujin Hwang (CS) we are training Machine Learning (ML) models
using the synthetic spectra obtained from cosmological simulations. The goal of this project
is to identify the cosmological simulations (with implemented physics) that best agree with
observed spectra, and to better understand degeneracies between different subgrid physics.
This project is in the early stages, exploring data compression and preparation methods and
identifying the best architectures for our purposes.

4.3

Additional Project: Cluster Mergers

I have worked with Dr. Sharon Felix and undergraduates Kate Shavelle (U. Columbia,
now Princeton) and Brandon Sike (UTD, now U. Michigan) on a project related to cluster
merger simulations (Felix et al., 2024). We modeled JKCS041, one of the most distant
galaxy clusters in the Universe for which resolved X-ray and SZ measurements are available.
This necessitated a cluster merger scenario in an ideal (isolated) simulation using GAMER2 (Schive et al., 2018). We plan to extend such work on cluster mergers to cosmological
simulations, where clusters have realistic shapes, substructure and surrounding large scale
structure. We have recently acquired access to the TNG-Cluster simulation which is a large
scale 1 Gpc3 extension of the IllustrisTNG suite (Nelson et al., 2024). With Kate Brown
and Nicolas Mazziotti (NSF REU students in summer 2024 at UTD and Maria Mitchell
Observatory, respectively), we have been using the TNG-Cluster data to mine cluster mergers
and look for systems identical to Abell 2146, which is an interesting system since idealized
simulations have not reproduced some of the observational features (such as discrepant X-ray
and lensing masses) (Chadayammuri et al., 2021), and analogues of JKCS041. Also involved
in this project is UTD undergraduate Lauren Mangu, and Brandon Sike.
