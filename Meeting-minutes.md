Lyman alpha forest

Stellar feedback
AGN feedback

# Methods:
- ML Train with synthetic data we have, test on another synthetic data
- Test with real data (compare)

# Statistical Analysis:
- Power spectrum of Lyman alpha (Lyman alpha flux power spectra)
    - Where the strongest absorption lines
    - Which model gives closest
- Column density...
- ...


Start by CAMEL doc, download, try running fake spectra

# Meeting 2
1P (standard) 1000 spectra; compare with other ones (like LH or CV or sth else)

Column density distribution
Voigt profile fitting (Mixture of Gaussian and Cauchy/Lorentzian)

1. Flux PDF
2. Power spectra
3. Column density distribution
4. Velocity distribution
